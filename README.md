A small summer project, to get better with React and its logic.

Some things to note:
 - This work is purely for self-educational purposes, it is not intended for distribution, hence the lack of proper testing, documentation and standard procedures.
 - I am still very much influenced by old Javascript design patterns, this is why I'm trying to create something more complex.
 - I will probably never finish this project but still keep it here if I will ever need it in the future.
